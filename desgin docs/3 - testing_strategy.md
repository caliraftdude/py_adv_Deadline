# 3. ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy - Deadline Interactive Fiction Port

## Existing Test Coverage Analysis

### Original ZIL Testing Environment

#### Built-in Debug Features
The original Deadline ZIL codebase likely included:
- **DEBUG.ZIL**: Debug utilities and testing commands
- **Interactive Debugging**: TOPS20 development environment debugging
- **Manual Testing**: Extensive gameplay testing by designers
- **Regression Testing**: Verification against previous game versions

#### Limited Automated Testing
Due to the era and development constraints:
- **No Unit Testing Framework**: ZIL lacked modern testing frameworks
- **Manual Verification**: Heavy reliance on human testers
- **Scenario-Based Testing**: Walkthrough-driven validation
- **Platform Testing**: Verification across different Z-machine implementations

## Comprehensive Testing Strategy for Python Port

### 1. Unit Testing Framework

#### Core Module Tests
```python
# Test Categories per Module:

# Parser Module Tests
class TestParser(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_command_parsing(self):
        # Verb recognition
        # Object identification
        # Ambiguity resolution
        # Invalid command handling
    
    def test_vocabulary_matching(self):
        # Synonym recognition
        # Partial word matching
        # Case insensitivity
        # Special characters

# Object System Tests  
class TestObjects(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_object_creation(self):
        # Object initialization
        # Property assignment
        # Hierarchy establishment
        # Container relationships
    
    def test_property_system(self):
        # Get/set operations
        # Property inheritance
        # Type validation
        # Default values

class TestTimeSystem(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_event_scheduling(self):
        # Event registration
        # Execution timing
        # Event cancellation
        # Priority handling
    
    def test_npc_schedules(self):
        # Character movement
        # Scheduled actions
        # Player interaction interrupts
        # State persistence
```

#### Test Data Management
```python
# Test fixture creation
@pytest.fixture
def game_world():
    """Create clean game state for testing"""
    return GameWorld.create_test_instance()

@pytest.fixture  
def sample_objects():
    """Standard test objects for validation"""
    return {
        'room': Room.create_test_room(),
        'item': Item.create_test_item(),
        'character': Character.create_test_npc()
    }
```

### 2. Integration Testing

#### Parser-Verb Integration
```python
class TestParserVerbIntegration(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_complete_command_flow(self):
        # Input parsing -> Verb selection -> Object manipulation
        # "take key" -> parse("take", "key") -> verb_take(key) -> key.location = player
    
    def test_complex_commands(self):
        # "put the brass key in the wooden box"
        # Multi-object interactions
        # Prepositional phrase handling
```

#### Game State Integration
```python
class TestGameStateIntegration(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_save_restore_cycle(self):
        # Complete game state preservation
        # Object state consistency
        # Time system state
        # Player progress validation
    
    def test_cross_system_interactions(self):
        # Time events affecting objects
        # Player actions triggering NPC responses
        # Inventory changes affecting descriptions
```

### 3. End-to-End Testing

#### Complete Gameplay Scenarios
```python
class TestGameplayScenarios(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_murder_investigation_flow(self):
        """Test complete investigation sequence"""
        # Initial scene examination
        # Evidence collection
        # Character interrogation
        # Solution presentation
    
    def test_time_sensitive_events(self):
        """Validate time-based gameplay"""
        # Events occurring on schedule
        # Player interference with timeline
        # Multiple timeline branches
    
    def test_multiple_solution_paths(self):
        """Verify different ways to solve puzzles"""
        # Alternative investigation approaches
        # Different evidence combinations
        # Various accusation scenarios
```

#### Story Walkthrough Tests
```python
class TestStoryWalkthroughs(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_optimal_playthrough(self):
        """Perfect solution path"""
        commands = [
            "examine body",
            "take note", 
            "north",
            "question mrs. robner about alibi",
            # ... complete optimal sequence
        ]
        self.execute_command_sequence(commands)
        self.assert_game_won()
    
    def test_failure_scenarios(self):
        """Common ways players can fail"""
        # Missing critical evidence
        # Incorrect accusations
        # Time running out
```

### 4. Property-Based Testing

#### Parser Robustness
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

class TestParserRobustness(unittest.TestCase):
    @given(st.text(min_size=1, max_size=100))
    def test_parser_never_crashes(self, random_input):
        """Parser should handle any text input gracefully"""
        try:
            result = self.parser.parse(random_input)
            self.assertIsNotNone(result)
        except GameException:
            pass  # Game exceptions are acceptable
        except Exception as e:
            self.fail(f"Parser crashed with unexpected exception: {e}")
    
    @given(st.lists(st.text(min_size=1, max_size=20), min_size=1, max_size=10))
    def test_multi_word_commands(self, word_list):
        """Test command parsing with various word combinations"""
        command = " ".join(word_list)
        result = self.parser.parse(command)
        self.assertIsInstance(result, ParseResult)
```

### 5. Performance Testing

#### Response Time Validation
```python
class TestPerformance(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_command_response_time(self):
        """Commands should respond within reasonable time"""
        start_time = time.time()
        self.game.execute_command("look")
        end_time = time.time()
        self.assertLess(end_time - start_time, 0.1)  # 100ms max
    
    def test_save_game_performance(self):
        """Save operations should be fast"""
        large_game_state = self.create_complex_game_state()
        start_time = time.time()
        large_game_state.save("test_save.dat")
        end_time = time.time()
        self.assertLess(end_time - start_time, 1.0)  # 1 second max
```

#### Memory Usage Testing
```python
def test_memory_usage_stability(self):
    """Extended gameplay shouldn't cause memory leaks"""
    import psutil
    import os
    
    process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
    initial_memory = process.memory_info().rss
    
    # Simulate extended gameplay
    for _ in range(1000):
        self.game.execute_random_command()
    
    final_memory = process.memory_info().rss
    memory_growth = final_memory - initial_memory
    
    # Memory growth should be reasonable
    self.assertLess(memory_growth, 50 * 1024 * 1024)  # 50MB max growth
```

### 6. Regression Testing

#### Version Comparison Tests
```python
class TestRegression(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_game_state_compatibility(self):
        """Save games from previous versions should load correctly"""
        for version_dir in glob.glob("test_saves/v*"):
            with self.subTest(version=version_dir):
                save_file = os.path.join(version_dir, "test_save.dat")
                game_state = GameState.load(save_file)
                self.validate_game_state_integrity(game_state)
    
    def test_solution_stability(self):
        """Known solutions should continue to work"""
        known_solutions = self.load_known_solutions()
        for solution_name, command_sequence in known_solutions.items():
            with self.subTest(solution=solution_name):
                game = self.create_fresh_game()
                for command in command_sequence:
                    game.execute_command(command)
                self.assertTrue(game.is_solved())
```

### 7. Edge Case Testing

#### Boundary Conditions
```python
class TestEdgeCases(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_inventory_limits(self):
        """Test behavior at inventory capacity"""
        # Fill inventory to capacity
        # Attempt to take additional items
        # Verify appropriate responses
    
    def test_object_state_transitions(self):
        """Test objects changing states"""
        # Items being used up
        # Doors opening/closing
        # Characters changing locations
    
    def test_time_boundary_events(self):
        """Test events at time boundaries"""
        # Midnight transitions
        # End-of-game time limits
        # Overlapping scheduled events
```

#### Error Handling
```python
def test_malformed_save_files(self):
    """Test behavior with corrupted save data"""
    corrupted_files = [
        "empty_file.dat",
        "truncated_save.dat", 
        "wrong_format.dat"
    ]
    for corrupt_file in corrupted_files:
        with self.subTest(file=corrupt_file):
            with self.assertRaises(SaveFileCorruptedException):
                GameState.load(corrupt_file)

def test_missing_game_files(self):
    """Test behavior when game data files are missing"""
    # Missing room descriptions
    # Missing object definitions
    # Missing vocabulary files
```

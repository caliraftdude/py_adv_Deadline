# 6. ðŸ§© Porting Plan - Deadline ZIL to Python 3.14 Migration Strategy

## Migration Overview

The porting of Deadline from ZIL to Python 3.14 will be executed in carefully planned phases, each building upon the previous phase while maintaining functionality and allowing for validation at each step. This approach minimizes risk and ensures that the final product preserves the original game's integrity while benefiting from modern Python capabilities.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3)

### Objectives

```

#### 1.2 Core Infrastructure Implementation
```python

## Risk Management Strategy

### Overall Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk Category | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Parser Compatibility** | Medium | High | Extensive testing, reference implementation |
| **Performance Issues** | Low | Medium | Profiling, optimization, iterative improvement |

| **Memory Leaks** | Low | Medium | Memory profiling, resource management |
| **Schedule Delays** | Medium | Low | Phased approach, milestone flexibility |

### Rollback Strategies

#### Phase-Level Rollbacks
Each phase includes defined rollback points:

```python
# Rollback procedures per phase:
Phase1_Rollback:
    - Revert to basic Python project structure
    - Fall back to simpler object system
    - Use alternative property management

Phase2_Rollback:  
    - Implement simpler parser (keyword-based)
    - Reduce vocabulary complexity
    - Use command shortcuts instead of natural language

Phase3_Rollback:
    - Generate objects from simplified templates
    - Reduce world complexity if needed
    - Use static object relationships

# Emergency rollback to previous working phase:
def emergency_rollback(target_phase: int):
    """Rollback to last known good state"""
    git_checkout(f"phase_{target_phase}_complete")
    restore_database_state(target_phase)
    notify_stakeholders(f"Rolled back to Phase {target_phase}")
```

### Quality Gates

Each phase must pass defined quality gates before proceeding:

```python
class QualityGate:
    def __init__(self, phase: int):
        self.phase = phase
        self.requirements = self._load_phase_requirements(phase)
    
    def validate_phase_completion(self) -> bool:
        """Validate all requirements met before proceeding"""
        results = []
        
        # Technical requirements
        results.append(self._check_test_coverage())
        results.append(self._check_performance_targets())
        results.append(self._check_code_quality())
        
        # Functional requirements
        results.append(self._check_feature_completeness())
        results.append(self._check_compatibility())
        
        return all(results)
    
    def generate_gate_report(self) -> str:
        """Generate detailed quality gate report"""
        # Detailed reporting logic
        pass

# Quality gate criteria:
PHASE_1_GATES = {
    'test_coverage': 90,
    'performance': 'meets_baseline',
    'core_features': 'complete',
    'documentation': 'adequate'
}

PHASE_2_GATES = {
    'parser_accuracy': 95,
    'command_coverage': 100,
    'performance': 'meets_targets',
    'integration': 'passes_all_tests'
}
```

### Communication and Reporting

#### Progress Tracking
```python
# Weekly progress reports:
class ProgressReport:
    def __init__(self, week: int, phase: int):
        self.week = week
        self.phase = phase
        self.completed_tasks = []
        self.in_progress_tasks = []
        self.blocked_tasks = []
        self.risks = []
        self.next_week_goals = []
    
    def generate_report(self) -> str:
        """Generate weekly progress report"""
        return f"""
        Week {self.week} Progress Report - Phase {self.phase}
        
        Completed: {len(self.completed_tasks)} tasks

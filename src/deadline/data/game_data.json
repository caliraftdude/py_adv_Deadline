  "intro_text": "DEADLINE\nBy Marc Blank\n\nYou are the Chief of Detectives. You've been summoned to the Robner estate to investigate the death of Mr. Marshall Robner, a wealthy industrialist. He was found dead in his locked bedroom this morning, apparently from an overdose of his prescribed sleeping medication.\n\nThe coroner has ruled it a suicide, but Mrs. Robner is not convinced. She has asked you to investigate further. You have 12 hours before the case will be officially closed.\n\nThe estate is large and the family members all seem to have their own secrets. You'll need to examine evidence carefully, question everyone, and piece together what really happened last night.\n\nGood luck, Inspector. Time is running out.",
  
  "victory_text": "CASE SOLVED!\n\nCongratulations! Through careful investigation and deduction, you have successfully proven that George Robner murdered his father with the assistance of Ms. Dunbar.\n\nGeorge, facing disinheritance and crushing gambling debts, conspired with Ms. Dunbar (who was having an affair with him) to kill Marshall Robner. They used an overdose of Ebullion mixed with Ms. Dunbar's LoBlo medication to ensure a fatal reaction, then staged the scene to look like suicide.\n\nThe ladder from the shed was used to access the library balcony after the murder, where they planted the fake suicide note. The mud on the ladder and in the library, along with the damaged roses, provided the crucial physical evidence.\n\nBoth George Robner and Ms. Dunbar have been arrested and will stand trial for murder.\n\nYour keen investigative skills have brought justice for Marshall Robner.",
  
  "failure_text": "CASE UNSOLVED\n\nUnfortunately, you have failed to solve the case in time. Without sufficient evidence to prove murder, the death of Marshall Robner will remain officially listed as a suicide.\n\nThe real killer has escaped justice, and the truth may never be known.\n\nPerhaps if you had been more thorough in your investigation, or questioned the suspects more carefully, you might have uncovered the evidence needed to solve this case.",
  
  "timeout_text": "TIME'S UP\n\nYour 12 hours have expired. The case is being closed as a suicide, as originally determined by the coroner.\n\nYou suspect there's more to the story - the inconsistencies in the evidence, the nervous behavior of certain family members, the mysterious circumstances - but without concrete proof, there's nothing more you can do.\n\nThe investigation is over. The truth will remain buried with Marshall Robner."
